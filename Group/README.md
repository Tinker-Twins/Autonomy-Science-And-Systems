# AuE-8230 Spring 2023 Group 1 - Tinker Twins

This directory hosts details of Group 1 for the course AuE-8230 during Spring 2023.

## Course Description:

**AuE-8230:** Autonomy: Science and Systems, as the name suggests, introduces students to scientific (formulations) as well as technological (ROS-based implementation) advances in the field of autonomous systems. This course is handled by [Dr. Venkat Krovi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatnkrovi), Michelin SmartState Chair Professor of Vehicle Automation at [Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR)](https://cuicar.com/) and director of [Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics Laboratory (ARMLab)](http://cecas.clemson.edu/armlab-cuicar).

**Tinker Twins:** [Chinmay Samak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samakchinmay) and [Tanmay Samak](https://in.linkedin.com/in/samaktanmay) are twin brothers, who use "Tinker Twins" as a personal brand (the team's name was therefore decided to reflect the same brand). The twins have come a long way tinkering with various tools and technologies, which has strengthened their scientific knowledge and skills. The duo has worked on various projects ranging from microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to in-orbit space settlements, and almost everything in between. They have a particularly keen interest in the field of robotics and autonomous systems, and are specializing in the field of autonomous vehicles.

**Chinmay Samak:** I received the [B.Tech. degree in Mechatronics Engineering](https://www.srmist.edu.in/program/b-tech-mechatronics-engineering/) with a gold medal from [SRM Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in/) in 2021. Having worked on several research projects in the field of autonomous vehicles, complemented with a solid background in mechatronics engineering, I have joined [ARMLab at CU-ICAR](http://cecas.clemson.edu/armlab-cuicar) as a direct Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of [Dr. Venkat Krovi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatnkrovi) to pursue focused research in the field of vehicle automation. My research interests lie at the intersection of real and virtual worlds to create physically and graphically accurate digital twins. I am currently contributing towards projects such as [VIPR-GS](https://cecas.clemson.edu/VIPR-GS/), [OpenCAV](https://sites.google.com/view/opencav/), [AutoDRIVE](https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io/) and [F1Tenth](https://f1tenth.org/).
